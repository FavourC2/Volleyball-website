    </p>

         2. Basic Gameplay:
    Volleyball is played by two teams, each with six players on the court. The game starts with a serve, where a player hits the ball over the net to the opposing team.
    Players then have three touches to return the ball to the opponent's side: bump, set, and spike.
Points are scored when the ball lands on the opponent's court.

    </p>

    <p>
     3. Scoring:
    Points are scored on every rally, regardless of which team served.
    Matches are typically played in sets, with the first team to reach a certain number of points winning the set.The team that wins a set usually needs to win by at least two points.
